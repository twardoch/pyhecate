1.  **Create Initial Project Documentation Files:**
    *   Create `PLAN.md` with an initial plan (this plan).
    *   Create `TODO.md` with initial tasks derived from the general goal of making the project well-functioning, elegant, and efficient.
    *   Create `CHANGELOG.md` to track changes.
2.  **Analyze `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`:**
    *   Identify any discrepancies or areas for improvement in the build and packaging configuration.
    *   Ensure dependencies are correctly listed and versioning is handled (seems `hatch-vcs` is used).
    *   `setup.py` seems to be a legacy file if `hatchling` is the build backend defined in `pyproject.toml`. Determine if `setup.py` is still needed or if it can be removed or simplified.
3.  **Review Core Logic in `pyhecate/__init__.py`:**
    *   Examine `PyHecateVideo` and `PyHecate` classes for clarity, efficiency, and error handling.
    *   Pay attention to subprocess calls (`ffmpeg`, `hecate`), file system operations, and overall workflow.
    *   Look for opportunities to refactor for better readability or performance.
4.  **Review CLI Handling in `pyhecate/__main__.py`:**
    *   Check argument parsing and how options are passed to the core classes.
    *   Verify logging setup and verbosity levels.
5.  **Examine Tests in `tests/test_pyhecate_video.py`:**
    *   Assess test coverage and the quality of existing tests.
    *   Identify areas where more tests are needed.
    *   Ensure tests are robust and mock external dependencies appropriately.
6.  **Address TODOs and Implement Improvements:**
    *   Based on the analysis, populate `TODO.md` with specific tasks.
    *   Implement changes, focusing on:
        *   **Elegance:** Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability. Apply linting (Ruff is configured) and formatting.
        *   **Efficiency:** Optimize performance where possible, especially in video processing.
        *   **Robustness:** Enhance error handling and make the application more resilient.
    *   Update documentation (`README.md`, docstrings) as changes are made.
    *   Keep `CHANGELOG.md` updated with all significant changes.
    *   Continuously update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` to reflect progress and new findings.
7.  **Run Linters and Tests:**
    *   After making changes, run `ruff` and `mypy` (as configured in `pyproject.toml`).
    *   Run `pytest` to ensure all tests pass.
8.  **Submit Changes:**
    *   Commit changes with a descriptive message.
